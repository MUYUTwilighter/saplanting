**Brief**

If you can not spare enough time and effort to plant saplings in Minecraft or the players on server are too lazy too do so, this datapack will help you!

When a sapling item drops on dirt(or something else that let saplings grow), it will automatically turn into sapling block for 2 seconds. The sapling-planting will not destroy the block that already take up the place(except air and blocks with tag"minecraft:replaceable").
